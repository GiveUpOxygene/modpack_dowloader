# modpack_downloader

## /!\ WIP /!\
A simple tool to download modpacks from CurseForge.

This work is most likely going to remain a WIP for long times. Indeed, I'm trying to scrape some data of CurseForge's pages' html code and it's not easy. I'm not a web developer and I'm not familiar with web scraping. I'm trying to learn it, but CurseForge anti-bot protection makes it very hard.
If I have some time in the future, I'll maybe consider going at it again.

Just launch it and it will download everything and creat the modpack that you can use on MultiMC
